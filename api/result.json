This is a huge market which has traditionally been underserved by tech companies \u2026 and the biggest issue it faces is loneliness.  As we age, our social circles inevitably shrink,\n\u2026 \u00b7  driven by divorce, illness, relocation and death. This means those over 50 are the loneliest generations alive today \u2013 and loneliness is worse for a senior\u2019s health than obesity or smoking. Many older adults have lots of things they want to do, but nobody to do them with. Stitch meets this need with a unique and vibrant social network with the ability to meet other like-minded people through member-driven group activities, travel, and one-on-one companionship. Stitch was named by Ford as one of the top trends for 2016 and is poised to become a major global cultural phenomenon.",
